# FAR: Lone Sails – LAN Co-op Mod

A BepInEx plugin that adds **2-player LAN co-op** to *FAR: Lone Sails*.
One player hosts, one player joins. Both walk around separately, and the vehicle,
fuel and boxes are synced.

> **2 players:** one host plus **one** partner, on the same LAN or a virtual LAN
> (Radmin VPN, Hamachi, ZeroTier). Direct internet play and more than 2 players are not supported.

## Features

- Host / join over LAN, with automatic LAN search (F2) or by typing the host IP
- The host runs the vehicle; the partner sees the same vehicle position, parts and fuel
- Partner can press vehicle buttons and levers, carry boxes and load fuel
- Each player walks independently; the partner is shown with a name tag
- The game only pauses when **both** players open the pause menu
- RESUME menu skipped automatically at game start

## Quick install (Windows)

Put `Install-FarCoop.bat` and `FarCoopMod.dll` into your FAR: Lone Sails folder (next to
`FarLoneSails.exe`) and run the .bat. It downloads and unpacks BepInEx 6.0.0-pre.1 and copies the
mod into `BepInEx\plugins`. You can also drag one or more game folders onto the .bat, or put it in a
folder that contains several game copies. Then start the game once and wait for the first-time setup.

The manual steps below do the same thing.

## Installation (do this on both PCs)

1. **Download BepInEx 6.0.0-pre.1 for IL2CPP x64:**
   `BepInEx_UnityIL2CPP_x64_6.0.0-pre.1.zip` from the
   [BepInEx releases page](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) (tag `v6.0.0-pre.1`).
   Newer BepInEx 6 builds will **not** load this mod.
2. **Extract the zip into the game folder**, next to `FarLoneSails.exe`.
   The folder should now contain `BepInEx\`, `mono\`, `winhttp.dll` and `doorstop_config.ini`.
3. **Start the game once and wait for the main menu.** The first start takes a few minutes,
   because BepInEx generates its files then. Then close the game.
4. **Copy `FarCoopMod.dll`** (from [Releases](../../releases)) into `BepInEx\plugins\`.
5. Start the game. A co-op panel appears in the top-left corner (F4 shows/hides it).

## How to play

1. Both players load the **same save / chapter**.
2. Host presses **F1**.
3. Partner presses **F2** to find the host on the LAN, **or** clicks the IP field, types the host address
   as `IP` or `IP:port` (e.g. `26.12.34.56:7777` for Radmin VPN) and presses Enter.
   The host's panel shows the addresses to share (`Share: ...`).
   The panel also has a **server list**: hosts found on the LAN plus your recent servers. Click one to join; **Refresh list** searches again.
4. Allow the game through Windows Firewall (Private networks) when asked.
   Ports used: TCP 7777, UDP 7778.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| F1 | Host |
| F2 | Find host on LAN and join |
| F3 | Disconnect |
| F4 | Show / hide co-op panel |
| F5 | Teleport to partner |

## Playing over Radmin VPN (or Hamachi / ZeroTier)

1. Both players install Radmin VPN and join the same network.
2. The host presses F1 and reads the `26.x.x.x:7777` address in the panel (the Radmin adapter's IP).
3. The partner types that address in the IP field and presses Enter. F2 (LAN search) may also work over the VPN.

## Testing with two games on one PC

1. Make a **second copy** of the game folder (each game needs its own `BepInEx` log and config).
2. Copy `Tools\Test-Host.bat` into the first folder and `Tools\Test-Client.bat` into the second, next to `FarLoneSails.exe`.
3. Run `Test-Host.bat`, then `Test-Client.bat`. Both start windowed (monitor 1 and 2); the client joins `127.0.0.1:7777` automatically.
4. Keyboard input goes to the focused window, so click the window you want to control.

Both copies use the same save files: avoid saving in both at once, and back up your save first.

Command-line options (for shortcuts): `-farcoop-host`, `-farcoop-join IP[:port]`, `-farcoop-name Name`.

## Settings

`BepInEx\config\com.dima.farlonesailscoop.cfg` is created after the first start. Edit it with the game closed.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Port | 7777 | TCP port the host listens on |
| DiscoveryPort | 7778 | UDP port for LAN search |
| Name | PC name | Name shown above you |
| PartnerBody | true | Partner gets a real body (buttons, pushing). Set false if the partner behaves strangely |
| SendRateHz | 30 | Sync updates per second (minimum 30) |
| AutoResumeOnStart | true | Skip the RESUME menu once at start |
| LastHostIp | | Last address used for Join IP (`IP` or `IP:port`) |
| PositionLog (Debug) | false | Write position diagnostics to the log every 5 s |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| No co-op panel | Check `FarCoopMod.dll` is in `BepInEx\plugins` and `BepInEx\LogOutput.log` contains `Loading [FAR LAN Coop` |
| F2 finds nothing | Type the host IP and press Enter; check the firewall on both PCs |
| "different mod version" | Both players need the same `FarCoopMod.dll` |
| Boxes in different places | Load the same save on both PCs |

Bug reports: please attach `BepInEx\LogOutput.log` from **both** PCs.

## Building from source

Visual Studio 2022+ with .NET Framework 4.7.2. In `FarCoopMod.csproj`, set `GameDir` to your game
folder (BepInEx must have been run once, so `BepInEx\unhollowed` exists). Optionally set `PartnerPluginsDir`
in `FarCoopMod.csproj.user` to also copy the DLL to a second PC.
Build Release; the DLL is copied to `BepInEx\plugins` automatically.
